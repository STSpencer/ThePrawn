Using GAIA-DR2 to understand the origin of the Kepler Period bimodality. A hack from the 2018 Wetton workshop (https://wetton.web.ox.ac.uk/)

Participants: S. Aigrain, O. Hall, L. Whitehouse, S. Spencer.

Background reading:
- McQuillan et al. (2014): Rotation Periods of 34,030 Kepler Main-Sequence Stars: The Full Autocorrelation Sample (https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5694)
- Davenport (2017): Rotating Stars from Kepler Observed with Gaia DR1 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08563)

Data sources:
- McQuillan et al. (2014) Kepler rotation period catalog (downloaded from Vizier and included in this repo)
- Cross-matched GAIA-DR2/Kepler catalog, thanks to M. Bedell. Download the 1arcsec Kepler x-match from gaia-kepler.fun
